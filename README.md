# Darvan's Website That Outlives Me

A personal website built with a simple, lasting approach - designed to remain accessible long after I'm gone.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a website that **remains even after I die**. A place that holds my work and thoughts, accessible to future generations. Life, work, and technical challenges kept getting in the way, but I kept coming back to this vision.

## How I Built It

**Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript - simple, fast, no heavy frameworks  
**Backend**: Jekyll - write posts as Markdown, publish immediately  
**Hosting**: GitHub Pages - as long as GitHub exists, my website exists  
**Domain**: darvan.krd - primary domain with automatic fallback to GitHub Pages  
**APIs**: Cloudflare Workers for secure translation and text-to-speech  

## The Legacy Strategy

**Simple & Lasting**: No databases, no complex infrastructure, no maintenance costs  
**GitHub Pages**: Leverages GitHub's longevity - free, always running, always alive  
**Static Generation**: Jekyll creates a site that doesn't depend on external services  
**Smart Fallback**: Automatic detection and redirect to GitHub Pages if darvan.krd is unavailable  

## What This Preserves

- **Life Stories**: Personal experiences from birth to present
- **Professional Journey**: Technology work and AI development  
- **Cultural Heritage**: Kurdish identity and values
- **Wisdom & Knowledge**: Lessons learned and insights gained
- **Service to Humanity**: Commitment to justice and equality

## Technical Choices for Immortality

- **No Servers**: GitHub Pages handles hosting
- **No Databases**: Static files that can't fail
- **No Dependencies**: Self-contained and reliable
- **Open Access**: Available to anyone, anywhere, anytime
- **Searchable**: Indexed by search engines for discovery

This is my personal website and digital legacy. It is not an open-source project and is not intended for contribution or modification by others. This is a private project that will serve as my lasting digital footprint.
