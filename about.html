      I am Darvan. My life has been shaped by struggle and curiosity. I dealt with perfectionism and the slow process of recovery. These things left scars, but they also gave me direction.
    </p>
    
    <p class="about-text">
      Technology became my main focus. I learned programming, explored data, and trained AI models. Over time I realized that building tech is empty if it does not help people. That is why I started Revge, my company. The purpose is clear: use data science and AI to solve problems, improve lives, and push my country forward.
    </p>
    
    <p class="about-text">
      My aim is simple but heavy. I want to serve humanity through knowledge and invention. I want to support the youth in Kurdistan and prove that innovation can carry meaning. I want to help preserve Kurdish language and culture through tech and education, so it grows stronger instead of fading. My faith drives me to keep going, and my vision is to leave behind work that matters, where tech is not progress for its own sake but a tool for justice, service, and God.

      <p class="founder-text">
        I studied Software and Informatics Engineering at Salahaddin University and continued with a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Kurdistan HewlÃªr. I founded Revge, an AI company, and Data.krd, the main source for Kurdish datasets. I created Vekol, the first Kurdish AI model. Through these efforts I have delivered many projects for government and business, building systems that address real needs.

        Outside of tech, I spend time with art, play the Oud, sing, go hiking, discover new things, and make new things.
