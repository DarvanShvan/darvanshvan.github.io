Alongside connecting with people and relationships, I discovered another kind of love, one that shaped my work and vision. I fell in love with data. I am interested in people’s data and all kinds of data. It was different from everything else, the cleanest and most honest form of love I had found. I enjoyed the process of collecting it, cleaning it, and watching the results take shape.

Data carries weight because it guides decisions. It shows the truth that opinions often miss. It makes improvements possible, not by guessing but by evidence. This is why I created Data krd as one of the products of Revge. The idea was clear: gather Kurdish data related to artificial intelligence, organize it, and use it as a foundation for future research and progress.

With Data krd, we aim to publish statistics, build datasets, and provide resources for anyone who wants to work on Kurdish AI. It is another way of serving my culture and my people, and of preserving our rich dialects and languages. Data krd is non-profit. It exists to satisfy my soul, to give me the feeling that I am serving, and to leave a fingerprint that stays even after we die. My curiosity doesn’t stop there. I want to follow how data moves, what it reveals, and how it can be transformed into something useful.
