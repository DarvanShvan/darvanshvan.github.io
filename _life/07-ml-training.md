After working across many areas of technology and programming, I needed to choose a path to go deeper. I chose artificial intelligence. Out of everything I had tried, AI made me feel happier and more at home. To me, the greatest change in human history is artificial intelligence, and building it through machines is the frontier that matters. My personality has always been challenging, always wanting to test limits and experiment, so this field fit me naturally.

I founded Revge as a company in AI. At the same time, I thought about strengthening my research skills in academia. I decided to pursue a master's degree in artificial intelligence abroad. That decision took me to Berlin, Germany. When I arrived I realized I could not adapt. Their routines, their lack of social connection, their culture, it did not feel like mine. I missed Kurdistan, my community, our nature and water, the life I knew. As the Kurdish proverb says, “A stone is heavy in its place.” I returned home without starting my studies, and when I landed in Kurdistan, I kissed the ground.

In 2024, at the age of 24, I began a master's degree in artificial intelligence at Kurdistan University instead. That choice felt right. I wanted my knowledge and my growth to serve my country and my people, not take me further away from them.

From Revge came another product: Vekol. It was dedicated to Kurdish AI models, built on top of the Kurdish data we had collected. Most of these models were created specifically for Kurds, designed to understand and serve our language and needs. Vekol makes it easier for people, institutions, and companies to speed up their work by using tools that are ours. It is a bridge between culture and technology, a step toward showing that we can create systems of our own, for ourselves.
