After years of working full-time, part-time, and remotely for different companies, and after being involved in major government projects, I noticed a clear problem. Management was weak, and the technical side wasn’t aimed at solving society’s real needs. Service to people was missing. If I had stayed in those companies, my technical skills would not have grown. There were no real opportunities for growth. It was a stable life, maybe even a good life, but it wasn’t meaningful. The failures I had in trying to set up a company before made this even more obvious. I analyzed those failures and saw that technical skill alone will never be enough to make a tech company succeed.

In 2023, at the age of 23, after spending time with dozens of experts and taking courses on building and growing companies, I decided to create something new. That’s how Revge was born.

Revge builds Kurdish AI models, datasets, and products. The work is about solving real problems for businesses, researchers, and organizations. At the same time, it’s about preserving culture and languages through technology. The goal is not only technical progress but progress with values: ethics, responsibility, and connection to the community.

The vision of Revge is simple. Grow into a global leader in AI while staying rooted in Kurdistan. Build systems that make life easier, safer, and more connected. Develop technologies that people can trust for their quality, their cultural relevance, and their impact.

The mission is to deliver AI that works in practice. Projects that start from the Kurdish community and then grow wider to the global stage. Every tool and product should be practical, reliable, and usable in real life.

The values of Revge are honesty and transparency. Respect for data, for language, and for culture. Belief in both research and technical skill. A will to share knowledge and build local capacity. Work for long-term benefit, not quick fixes. Every project is treated as a responsibility to leave a mark that matters, for both the community and humanity.

Revge is more than a company. It is part of my search for building systems that connect technology with identity, and progress with culture.
