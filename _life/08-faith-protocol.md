Through every stage of my life, from childhood struggles to building projects in technology, I held onto one thing above everything else: God. He is the Creator, the One without equal. Everything exists because He wills it. Whatever He wants happens, and whatever He does not want will never happen. He has power over all things, and He is generous and kind. Life itself, happiness and freedom, are gifts from Him. Our return after death is to Him, and He is the One we must worship if we want to reach Paradise.

Religion to me is not only belief, it is a system that gives life meaning. It is guidance, rules, and commands that make life purposeful, rewarding good and punishing evil. There are religions created by men, but there are also heavenly religions sent by God through His prophets and His books. Islam is the last of these heavenly religions, the final path that God commands us to believe in. For me, there is no need to build on the words of other people when they too were created by God. The message is complete.

The prophets were human beings chosen by God to deliver His message. They were bearers of truth, capable of miracles only through His command. Their role was to guide people to faith and remind them of the Creator. The last prophet is Muhammad, peace be upon him, and believing in him is part of the faith God has asked from us.

Life is a test, a temporary stage. God has provided everything needed for survival, but He has also given humans something more than other beings: intelligence. With that comes responsibility. Some use it to build and repair life, while others use it to destroy. Our task is to live with purpose, to rebuild, to benefit others, and to grow in both this world and the Hereafter.

Humans are honored with reason and choice. We are not immortal, but we are accountable. Each person was created for a purpose, and discovering that purpose is part of living. We carry both body and soul, and our actions define whether we are rewarded or punished.

Thought is part of this gift. It separates us from other creatures. Thinking, questioning, seeking answers, interpreting the world through senses and knowledge, this is what makes us human. Good thoughts guide good actions. Bad thoughts can ruin both life and soul. Philosophy itself is only a way of searching for wisdom, but wisdom belongs to God. True strength comes when reason supports faith.

Happiness is not wealth, not possessions. It is peace, health, giving, belief in God, and a clear purpose. It is knowing yourself, having conviction, and living in worship and good relationships. Discomfort and sorrow are natural. No one escapes them. God tests us through them to make us strong. With patience, prayer, trust, and good deeds, difficulties become steps forward, not blocks.

Values are the roots of dignity. They show right and wrong, they shape behavior, they give life structure. Integrity, honesty, service, generosity, respect for people and land, these are values that must be lived, not spoken. Without values, behavior collapses. With them, life has direction.

For me, holding onto God in this digital storm keeps me grounded. Technology, AI, data, success, all of it means nothing if faith and values are missing. Faith is the first protocol, the base layer. Everything else is built on it. We all need to send this signal to God, to connect with Him, because without that connection, life loses its meaning.
