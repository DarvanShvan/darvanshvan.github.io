At some point I realized life is not only about what I achieve while I am alive. It is about what remains after me. Skills, projects, and even success will fade, but the impact we leave becomes our legacy. Thinking beyond myself changed how I see everything I do.

Legacy is not only about big monuments or famous names. It can be knowledge shared, culture preserved, or opportunities created for others. It can be a dataset that future researchers use, or a system that helps a student learn faster. Even small acts, if done with honesty, can live longer than us.

For me, uploading a legacy means recording what matters and passing it on. It means creating things that do not die when I do. This is why I care about building Kurdish AI, protecting language, preserving archives, and serving my community. These are fingerprints that stay after I am gone.

I do not want to leave the world empty-handed. I want my work to speak when I can no longer speak. Legacy is my way of giving back to the land, the people, and the God who gave me life. And for example, how I made my personal website, it remains as part of my legacy. In the long term I explain this in my blog [Legacy Upload](/2025/08/31/building-my-website-that-outlives-me/).
