My mind was built to think in 0.5, always looking for the balance and the middle ground. But when it came to action, I demanded 0 or 1. Black or white. Done or failed. This contradiction shaped my days. I would plan with flexibility, yet execute with a rigid hand.

Sometimes perfection pushed me forward. It made me review, fix, polish, and refuse to accept low quality. But most of the time it turned into a trap. I left projects unfinished because they weren’t “perfect” yet. I delayed decisions, lost time, and carried constant stress on my shoulders.

It was like chasing an image in my head that never existed in reality. Perfectionism became both my tool and my enemy. It sharpened my skills, but it cut my progress. It taught me discipline, but it stole my freedom. Living with it was like coding a system where every bug fix created another bug.

Over time, I tried to change. Through courses I took, lessons from leaders I watched or met, and books I studied, I began to step away from that destructive loop. I learned that perfection is not the goal, progress is. Small steps matter more than flawless plans. And while the instinct is still there, I fight to keep it in check. Every project now is a reminder that growth comes from finishing, not from endless polishing.
