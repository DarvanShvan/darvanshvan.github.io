After years of studying, working, struggling with myself, and building projects, I began to see a bigger purpose. Knowledge, skills, and technology mean nothing if they stay locked inside one person. The real value is when they serve others. Humanity is not perfect, but we are all connected. What I create, what I build, should not only serve me, my family, or my country, but should also serve people everywhere.

Serving humanity does not mean becoming famous or collecting praise. It means doing work that leaves a trace, something that others can use, something that makes life a little easier, fairer, or more meaningful. Even a small contribution can ripple forward. It could be a tool, an idea, or even a moment of kindness.

I realized that my purpose is not only to code, research, or run companies. It is to use these abilities for service. Whether it is through preserving Kurdish language with AI, building data resources, or creating models that people can depend on, all of it connects to this larger goal. I want my work to stand as service to people I will never meet.

Life is short. We are not immortal. What remains after us is what we gave. Serving humanity is the way I measure myself now. If I can give something useful, if I can protect culture, if I can create systems that others can build on, then my existence will have meaning. This is the big image. Everything else is only steps leading to it.
