My dream has always been larger than myself. I want to serve Kurdistan. This land of mountains, rivers, and history has carried us through endless struggle. Our people have resisted, fought, and survived without surrender. Even today, Kurdistan is not free as a state, but it lives inside us. It is our identity, our duty, and our hope.

For me, building technology is not only about research or products. It is about nation building. Every dataset, every model, every company, every idea should add strength to Kurdistan. Preserving our language, documenting our culture, and creating opportunities for our youth are not side projects, they are the foundation.

I believe nation building starts with knowledge and service. A nation grows when its people gain skills, when they have pride in their identity, and when they create systems that belong to them. For Kurds, this means making tools that are ours, not borrowed, and showing the world that we are capable of building and leading.

Kurdistan deserves more than survival. It deserves to flourish. My dream is to see our universities, our companies, our people contributing to global progress while staying rooted here. My role, as I see it, is to take what I know and use it to open doors for others.

Nation building is the path that ties my personal story to the larger story of my people. It is where my work, my faith, and my purpose meet.
